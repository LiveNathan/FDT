# Frequency Dependent Truncation (FDT)
Tools for Frequency Dependent Truncation of Impulse Responses. FDT facilitates removing acoustic high-pass reflections (e.g. from equipment) in impulse responses conducted in anechoic rooms without introducing errors in the bass regime.
FDT based on a Short-Time Fourier Transform framework as proposed in the paper is implemented in the function [FDTruncate](/Truncation_Functions/FDTruncate.m)

This is supplementary material to the publication [1]. There, the scientific details of the methods are explained. When you use these tools in your scientific work, please cite [1].

Tested under Matlab R2017a on Windows.
